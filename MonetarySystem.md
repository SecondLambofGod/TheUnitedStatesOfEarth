The monetary system will use blockchain technology and digital devices. Banks, coins, and paper money will no longer be necessary because of the adoption of a distributed ledger on a webapp. Money will be created and given directly to the poorest people on Earth instead of money being created to buy corporate bonds and securities. The money will flow up from the poor to the rich in this system, instead of money flowing to the richest people directly from Central Banks. Everyone in every nation on Earth will exchange their old money for the new United Currency of Earth.
