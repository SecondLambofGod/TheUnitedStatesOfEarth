Anyone can propose legislation and everyone votes on all legislation. If you choose to you can delegate your legislation votes to a registered delegate who will vote for you. Once a bill reaches a quorum with the people it goes to the Senate. There is only one chamber, not two. Senators are elected representatives whose only job is to vote on legislation that reaches a quorum with the people. Senators do not propose legislation. Once the bill passes the Senate it goes to the Chief Executive to sign the bill into law.

Senators will not be elected from geographic districts. Instead we will use something called Decentralized Representation. The total population of Earth will be divided randomly into approximately 4000 sets of 2,000,000 people. Each of these random sets of people will elect a representative to the Senate. So, there will be approximately 4000 Senators in the Senate.
