Anyone can propose legislation and everyone votes on all legislation. If you choose to you can delegate your legislation votes to a registered delegate who will vote for you. There will be a limit on the amount of voters a delegate can represent. Once a bill reaches a quorum with the people it goes to the Senate. There is only one chamber, not two. Senators are elected representatives whose only job is to vote on legislation that reaches a quorum with the people. Senators do not propose legislation. Once the bill passes the Senate it goes to the Chief Executive to sign the bill into law.

Senators will not be elected from geographic districts. Instead we will use something called Decentralized Representation. The total population of Earth will be divided randomly into approximately 4000 sets of 2,000,000 people. Each of these random sets of people will elect a representative to the Senate. So, there will be approximately 4000 Senators in the Senate.

The Chief Executive will be elected through three or four rounds of voting with a progressively smaller field of candidates in each round until the final round of voting of just two candidates. The candidate with the most votes in the final round of voting becomes Chief Executive.
